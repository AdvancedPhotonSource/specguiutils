specguiutils is a python library that provides gui elements that display scan information from a SPEC file, and allows the user
to pick a particular scan or scans and then display/process information about that scan.  Note that this library uses spec2nexus
 reader (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spec2nexus) to read and parse the spec file.
